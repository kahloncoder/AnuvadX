# AnuvadX - Multilingual AI Assistant

## Overview

AnuvadX is an innovative multilingual AI assistant designed to bridge communication gaps, particularly within the diverse linguistic landscape of India. Recognizing that users interact in various languages like Hindi, Punjabi, Simple English, and Hinglish, AnuvadX provides seamless interaction, translation, and content summarization across text, documents, images, and real-time voice/camera inputs. It leverages powerful Large Language Models (LLMs) via APIs like Groq and Google Gemini to offer a unified and efficient solution.

## Why AnuvadX?

India's rich linguistic diversity presents unique challenges for information access. AnuvadX addresses this by offering:

*   **Inclusion and Accessibility:** Supporting multiple Indian languages and interaction modes ensures vital information and digital tools are available to a broader audience.
*   **Efficiency:** Utilizing robust LLM APIs (Groq Llama 3, Google Gemini) allows for complex tasks like translation, summarization, and vision analysis to be handled quickly and effectively within a single application.
*   **Multi-Modal Interaction:** Integrates text chat, PDF processing, image analysis, and real-time voice and camera capabilities, making information processing versatile and intuitive.
*   **Integrated Solution:** Combines multiple AI functionalities into one cohesive Streamlit application, showcasing how different services can work together.

## Key Features and Their Benefits

AnuvadX offers a suite of features accessible through intuitive tabs:

**1. ðŸ’¬ Intelligent Chatbot**
*   **What It Does:** Detects the input language and responds conversationally in the user's preferred language (Simplified English, Hindi, Hinglish, or Punjabi) using Groq's Llama 3 model.
*   **How It Helps:** Facilitates natural communication for users regardless of their primary language, useful in education, customer support, and daily interactions.

**2. ðŸ“„ PDF Summarizer**
*   **What It Does:** Extracts text from uploaded PDF documents (using PyPDF2) and generates a concise summary in the user's chosen language (using Groq).
*   **How It Helps:** Saves time by quickly providing the essence of lengthy reports, research papers, or articles.

**3. ðŸ–¼ Image Analysis**
*   **What It Does:** Analyzes uploaded images using vision models (Gemini Vision or Groq Llama 3 Vision) to describe content or extract text, providing results in the preferred language. Falls back to OCR (Tesseract) if vision models fail or are unavailable.
*   **How It Helps:** Allows users to understand images containing text (signs, notes, diagrams) or get descriptions of visual content without needing separate tools.

**4. ðŸ”¤ Word-for-Word Translation**
*   **What It Does:** Takes text input and provides a detailed word-for-word translation along with a summary meaning in the selected language (using Groq).
*   **How It Helps:** Useful for language learners or situations requiring precise understanding of specific terms alongside the overall context.

**5. ðŸ“œ English-to-Punjabi PDF Translator (New Feature)**
*   **What It Does:** Translates entire **English** PDF documents, including text and tables (using Camelot), into **Punjabi (Gurmukhi script)**. Generates downloadable translated PDF (preserving layout via ReportLab) and TXT files. Requires **Google Gemini API Key**.
*   **How It Helps:** Provides high-fidelity document translation, preserving structure like tables, crucial for official documents, educational materials, and reports needing accurate Punjabi versions.

**6. ðŸŽ¤ Voice & Camera Assistant**
*   **What It Does:** Enables hands-free interaction via voice commands (using SpeechRecognition & gTTS) and analyzes real-time video feed from the camera (using OpenCV and Gemini/Groq Vision). Users can ask questions, request analysis of objects/text shown to the camera, etc.
*   **How It Helps:** Offers an interactive, multi-modal experience for on-the-go analysis, accessibility for visually impaired users, and a dynamic way to query the real world.

## Project Structure

The project follows a Streamlit application structure:

## Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/AnuvadX.git # Replace with your actual repo URL
    cd AnuvadX
    ```

2.  **Install Python Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    *(Ensure you have Python 3.8+ installed)*

3.  **Install System Dependencies:**
    *   **Tesseract OCR Engine:** Required for the image analysis OCR fallback (`pytesseract`).
        *   Linux: `sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install tesseract-ocr`
        *   Mac: `brew install tesseract`
